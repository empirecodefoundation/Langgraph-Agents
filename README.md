# Langgraph-Agents
Welcome to Langgraph-Agents, where we create agents using Langgraph - a working demonstration in Streamlit! This innovative project is part of our open-source initiative at Empire Code Foundation, aiming to push the boundaries of AI and technology accessibility.

## Project Description
Langgraph-Agents leverages the powerful Langgraph library to construct dynamic agents capable of performing a variety of tasks. Integrated with Streamlit, this project provides a user-friendly interface to interact with, manage, and visualize the performance of these agents. Our agents are versatile, allowing for integration with various tools such as Tavily Search, Eleven Labs Text-to-Speech, and DALL-E Image Generation.

## Features
- **Dynamic Agent Creation**: Create multiple agents with distinct roles and capabilities.
- **Tool Integration**: Utilize an array of tools, enhancing the functionality and versatility of your agents.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A seamless and interactive interface for managing and visualizing your agents.
- **Open Source Collaboration**: Be part of a community-driven project, contributing to the development and enhancement of Langgraph-Agents.
